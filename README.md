Personal Project #2
Hello this is my second personal project. I'm sorry for not commiting every change I was making during writing this program, but I did not expect this to even work. This is 100% my own code and my own idea. Program is a little bit clunky but for my purpose it works as supposed. I'm  open to any advice how to improve my work and how to improve as dev. I've tried to include some basic OOP into this project and basic ideas such as dividing project into seperate files but IDK if I did this correct or not. 
Cheers
